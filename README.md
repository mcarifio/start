# start

How to start things by topic, e.g. `checklist/workday` is a checklist for starting my workday
and `pl/python3` is how to start a python project.

This is highly personal and specific to me. But perhaps you can cherrypick some useful things. (I doubt it.)

Some of this could be augmented by git templates. When I learn git templates.
